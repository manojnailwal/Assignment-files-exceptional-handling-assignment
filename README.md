# Python File Handling & Logging Assignment

This repository contains an assignment that demonstrates various concepts and tasks related to file handling, exception handling, logging, and error management in Python. It includes solutions to practical programming questions that involve reading, writing, and manipulating files, as well as handling common exceptions like `FileNotFoundError`, `IndexError`, and `KeyError`.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find Python programs that address key topics such as:

- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files, checking if a file is empty, appending data, and handling file errors.
- **Exception Handling**: Using `try-except` blocks to manage different types of exceptions, such as division by zero and accessing non-existent dictionary keys.
- **Logging**: Implementing basic logging functionality to track errors and events in your Python programs. Includes setting up log files, using different logging levels, and handling errors in file handling operations.
- **Memory Management**: Includes handling memory usage and profiling for small Python programs.
  
Each Python program is designed to showcase a practical use case and provides solutions to common challenges faced during file manipulation and exception handling.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts.
3. Run the individual Python programs to see how they solve different problems related to file handling, exception handling, and logging.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `logging` module for error tracking
- `os` module for file handling
- JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
